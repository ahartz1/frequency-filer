# Frequency Filer
## Normal Mode
This program looks for a file called sample.txt. This file will contain the text of a book, part of a book, or speech in plain text format. It reads this file and then returns the top 20 words used in the text and the number of times they are used.

## Hard Mode
Added Features:
 * List of common words removed from results
 * User is able to specify file to assess on the command line by running `python3 word_frequency.py FILENAME`
