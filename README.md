# Frequency Filer
## Normal Mode
This program looks for a file called sample.txt. This file will contain the text of a book, part of a book, or speech in plain text format. It reads this file and then returns the top 20 words used in the text and the number of times they are used.

## Hard Mode
#### Added Features:

 * __Common words omitted.__ The following list of common words was removed from results
